# âœ¨ Features

UVerify's main feature is a notary service that enables you to store file or text hashes on the Cardano blockchain. The UI is simple and intuitive, enabling users to define metadata alongside the file or text to be hashed. Some metadata fields can even customize the certificate's appearance.

- **`uverify_template_id`:** Use this field to tailor the certificate's look and feel.
- **Custom Templates:** Contribute by adding new templates or restricting templates to your users only, leveraging the Web3 Partnership System.

### Key Features:
