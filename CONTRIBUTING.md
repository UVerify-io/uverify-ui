## 📝 Guidelines

1. **Open an Issue First**  
   Before starting work on a feature or task, please open an issue in the repository to align with the project goals. This helps avoid duplicate efforts and ensures your contribution fits the project's vision.

   - `docs: update README with new feature details`
   - `chore: update dependencies to latest versions`

3. **Sign the CLA**  
   All contributors must sign the **Contributor License Agreement (CLA)** before their contributions can be merged. This ensures that the project remains open and accessible to everyone.

4. **Pull Requests**

   - Fork the repository and create a new branch for your changes.
   - Ensure your code is well-documented and follows the project's coding standards.
   - Submit a pull request with a clear description of your changes.

5. **Testing**
